    shows you which color space contains your color.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multiple Color Spaces" icon="palette">
    Choose from sRGB, HSL, HWB, LAB, LCH, OKLCH, OKLAB, and wide-gamut RGB
    spaces. Convert between them seamlessly.

## Try it out

<ColorInputDemo
  value="#0bf8"
  description="Interact with the color picker below. The readout updates as you adjust the color."
/>

:::tip[Why OKLCH?]
OKLCH provides perceptually uniform lightness and chroma, making it ideal for creating accessible color scales and harmonious palettes.

## Quick Start

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Usage">
    ```html
    <script type="module">
      import 'color-input'
    </script>

    <color-input value="oklch(75% 30% 180)"></color-input>
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">
    <ColorInputDemo
      value="oklch(75% 30% 180)"
      showCode={false}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
The custom element auto-registers when you import the module. Use it in any HTML document or framework.
:::

:::caution[Browser Support]
The Popover API is required. Modern browsers (Chrome 114+, Safari 17+, Firefox 125+) support it natively.
