## Overview

The `<color-input>` element provides three methods:

- `show()` - Opens the picker popover
- `close()` - Closes the picker popover
- `setAnchor(element)` - Sets a custom anchor for positioning

## show()

Opens the picker popover programmatically:

```js
const picker = document.querySelector('color-input');
picker.show();
```

This is equivalent to clicking the trigger button. An `open` event is fired when the popover opens.

## close()

Closes the picker popover:

```js
picker.close();
```

A `close` event is fired when the popover closes.

## setAnchor(element)

Sets a custom anchor element for popover positioning:

```js
const customAnchor = document.querySelector('#my-anchor');
picker.setAnchor(customAnchor);
```

By default, the popover positions relative to the trigger button. Use `setAnchor()` to position relative to a different element.

## Next Steps

- [Events](/api/events) - Listen for open, close, and change events
- [Properties](/api/properties) - Read and write properties dynamically
